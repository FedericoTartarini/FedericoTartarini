### Hi, I'm [Federico Tartarini][website] üëã

I am a Horizon Fellow and Senior Lecturer in the School of Architecture, Design and Planning at the [University of Sydney](https://www.sydney.edu.au/). 
My background is in üë®‚Äçüíªüî¨ [Energy Engineering](https://corsi.unibo.it/2cycle/EnergyEngineering).
I am passionate about research and open-source software development. 
My academic work focuses on human thermal comfort, indoor environmental quality (IEQ), HVAC systems, thermoregulation, and physiological sensing.

My mission is to enable evidence-based, occupant-centric building design through transparent and accessible tools. 
I actively contribute to open science by developing and maintaining free, open-source software for researchers and practitioners in the built environment.

You can explore my publications on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QcamSPwAAAAJ&hl=en) [![ORCID](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=ORCID&message=0000-0002-8739-5062&color=green&style=flat-square&logo=orcid)](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8739-5062)

üîß Key Projects
I have contributed to the development of several research tools and applications:

* [pythermalcomfort] - to calculate thermal comfort and heat stress indices based on international standards.
* [HeatWatch] - provides personalised heat stress risk scores and evidence-based cooling recommendations.
* [CBE Thermal Comfort Tool] ‚Äî an interactive online calculator for evaluating thermal comfort conditions.
* [Cozie Apple] - a real-time data collection framework for building occupant feedback and physiological sensing.
* [CBE Clima Tool] - supports climate-driven design decisions for architects and engineers through climate data analysis.
* [Sports and Medicine Australia - Extreme Heat Tool] - offers practical guidance to mitigate heat risks during sports activities.
* [Cozie Fitbit] - etends the Cozie framework to Fitbit devices for real-world physiological data collection.

üéì Research Interests

* Human thermal comfort modelling and indices
* Indoor environmental quality (IEQ) assessment
* Physiological data acquisition and interpretation
* Software tools for occupant-centric building design

üé• Educational Content

I regularly share knowledge and tutorials on my [YouTube channel], covering topics including:

* LaTeX and Beamer
* Python
* Typst
* PyCharm
* Docusaurus
* ReactJS

üåç Outreach Websites
I have also authored several public-facing web tools:

* [COVID-19 aerosol infection risk estimator] ‚Äî Models aerosol transmission risks in indoor spaces.
* [Air Quality and Weather - Singapore] - Real-time air quality and meteorological data.
* [Dengue Singapore] - Tracks dengue risk using real-time weather and public health data

ü§ù Support and Collaboration

I am open to collaborations with researchers, students, and industry partners. If you find my work valuable, you can support my efforts by:
