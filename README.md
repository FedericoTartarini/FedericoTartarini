### Hi, I'm [Federico Tartarini][website] üëã

I'm an üë®‚Äçüíªüî¨ [Energy Engineer](https://corsi.unibo.it/2cycle/EnergyEngineering) with a passion for research and software development. 
I am an Horizon Fellow | Senior Lecturer at the School of Architecture Design and Planning at the [University of Sydney]([https://www.berkeley.edu](https://www.sydney.edu.au/)). 

My work primarily revolves around thermal comfort, Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ), Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems, thermoregulation, and software development. You can read my papers on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QcamSPwAAAAJ&hl=en) [![ORCID](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=ORCID&message=0000-0002-8739-5062&color=green&style=flat-square&logo=orcid)](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8739-5062)

I'm proud to have contributed to various projects, including: 
* [pythermalcomfort] - to calculate complex thermal comfort and heat stress indexes.
* [HeatWatch] - calculates personalised heat stress risk and provides evidence-based recommendations.
* [CBE Thermal Comfort Tool] - to calculate and visualise the results of complex thermal comfort calculations.
* [Cozie Apple] - a framework to collect feedback from building occupants and physiological data in real time.
* [CBE Clima Tool] - to perform a climate analysis, specifically designed to help architects and engineers.
* [Sports and Medicine Australia - Extreme Heat Tool] - to provide evidence-based guidance to protect the health of those participating in sports.
* [Cozie Fitbit].

I'm also passionate about education, and you can find me sharing my knowledge on my [YouTube channel].
You can learn about LaTeX, Python, Typst, PyCharm, Beamer, Docusaurus, ReactJS, and more there. 
I'm confident you'll find my videos helpful.

Additionally, I've authored several websites that cater to different interests. 
You can explore the [COVID-19 aerosol infection risk estimator], [Air Quality and Weather - Singapore], and [Dengue Singapore] to access valuable information in those domains.

Let's collaborate and make a difference together!
